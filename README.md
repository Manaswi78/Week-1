# Week-1
I've completed several important preprocessing steps for your e-waste classification project:

Loading Dataset from ZipFile: Extracting the dataset from a zip file is the initial step to access the image data. This is required because the data was provided in a compressed format.
Understanding Structure of Directories: Examining the directory structure helps you understand how the dataset is organized into training, testing, and validation sets, and how the different e-waste classes are separated within those sets. This understanding is crucial for navigating the dataset and building input pipelines for your model.

Traversing and checking if all folders have equal number of images: Checking for class balance is essential to identify potential biases in your dataset. If some classes have significantly fewer images than others, your model might perform poorly on those underrepresented classes. Knowing the class distribution helps you decide if techniques like data augmentation or weighted loss functions are needed to address imbalance.
Displaying Sample Images: Visualizing sample images allows you to inspect the data, understand its characteristics, and ensure that the images were loaded correctly. This is a good practice to catch any issues early on.

Resizing Images: Resizing images to a uniform dimension is often a requirement for deep learning models. Many model architectures expect input images of a fixed size. Resizing ensures consistency in the input data and can help with computational efficiency.

These preprocessing steps are fundamental requirements in most image classification projects. They ensure that your data is accessible, organized, understood, and in a suitable format for training a machine learning model.
