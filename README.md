# Week-1
This project uses EfficientNetV2B0 to classify e-waste images into categories like phones, batteries, and circuit boards. It leverages transfer learning for high accuracy and efficient performance. OpenCV is used for preprocessing, making it suitable for smart recycling and automated e-waste sorting applications.
